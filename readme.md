# London Crime Data Visualization

This repository hosts the London Crime Data Visualization project. My objective is to use Python to create clear and consistent data visualizations from the [London Crime Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jboysen/london-crime), covering the period from January 2008 to December 2016.

## Dataset

The dataset we used is available on Kaggle and contains information about crime in London. Here's what each column represents:

- `lsoa_code`: Policing area code.
- `borough`: London borough.
- `major_category`: Major crime category.
- `minor_category`: Minor crime category.
- `value`: Crime count for a specific borough in a particular month.
- `year`: Year of the summary statistic.
- `month`: Month of the summary statistic.

Access the dataset [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jboysen/london-crime).

## GeoJSON Source

I've also used a GeoJSON source to visualize crime geospatially. This source provides geographical data for London. Access it [here](https://skgrange.github.io/data.html).
